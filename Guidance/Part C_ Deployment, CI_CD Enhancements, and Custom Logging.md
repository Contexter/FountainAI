## 2. Deployment to AWS Lightsail

### 2.1 AWS Lightsail Overview

**AWS Lightsail** is a simplified cloud platform offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that provides easy-to-use virtual private servers (instances), storage, and networking capabilities. It is ideal for deploying small to medium-sized applications and is cost-effective, making it suitable for projects with budget constraints.

### 2.2 Cost Management

To adhere to the **70 Euros per month** budget for all AWS services, it's crucial to select appropriate instance types and manage resource usage effectively.

**Cost Breakdown:**

- **Compute Instances:** Choose instances that balance performance with cost. For example:
  - **$3.50/month:** 512 MB RAM, 1 vCPU, 20 GB SSD
  - **$5/month:** 1 GB RAM, 1 vCPU, 40 GB SSD
  - **$10/month:** 2 GB RAM, 1 vCPU, 60 GB SSD

- **Data Transfer:** AWS Lightsail includes a certain amount of data transfer per month. Monitor usage to avoid additional charges.

- **Storage:** Ensure that the SSD storage allocated suffices for your application needs without over-provisioning.

**Recommendation:**

- Start with **$10/month** instances for each service to ensure adequate resources.
- Scale down if resource utilization remains low.
- Utilize monitoring tools to track usage and adjust instances accordingly.

### 2.3 Setting Up AWS Lightsail Instances

**Steps to Create and Configure Instances:**

1. **Log in to AWS Console:**
   - Navigate to the [AWS Lightsail Console](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/).

2. **Create a New Instance:**
   - Click on **"Create instance"**.
   - **Choose an Instance Location:** Select the region closest to your user base to minimize latency.
   - **Select a Platform:** Choose **Linux/Unix**.
   - **Select a Blueprint:** Choose **OS Only** and select **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS**.
   - **Choose an Instance Plan:** Select the plan that fits within your budget. For example, **$10/month** per instance.
   - **Name Your Instance:** Use descriptive names (e.g., `central-sequence-service`, `character-management-api`).

3. **Repeat the Process:**
   - Create separate instances for each microservice (total of five) to ensure isolation and scalability.

4. **Access Your Instances:**
   - Use the **SSH** button in the Lightsail console to access each instance or set up SSH keys for secure access.

### 2.4 Configuring Security Groups

**Security groups** in Lightsail act as virtual firewalls to control inbound and outbound traffic to your instances.

**Steps to Configure:**

1. **Navigate to Networking:**
   - In the Lightsail console, go to the **"Networking"** tab.

2. **Manage Firewall Settings:**
   - For each instance, configure the firewall to allow necessary ports:
     - **SSH (Port 22):** For secure remote access.
     - **HTTP (Port 80):** For web traffic (if applicable).
     - **HTTPS (Port 443):** For secure web traffic.
     - **Custom Ports:** As required by your applications (e.g., FastAPI typically uses port 8000).

3. **Example Firewall Rules:**

   | Port | Protocol | Description                    |
   |------|----------|--------------------------------|
   | 22   | TCP      | SSH access                     |
   | 80   | TCP      | HTTP traffic                   |
   | 443  | TCP      | HTTPS traffic                  |
   | 8000 | TCP      | FastAPI application            |
   | 8001 | TCP      | Kong Admin API (secured access)|

4. **Restrict Access:**
   - Limit SSH access to specific IP addresses if possible to enhance security.

5. **Apply Changes:**
   - Save the firewall settings to apply the rules to your instances.

### 3.3 Deploying Docker Compose on AWS Lightsail Instances

Deploy your Docker Compose configuration on each AWS Lightsail instance to run your microservices.

**Steps:**

1. **Transfer `docker-compose.yml` to Each Instance:**

   Use `scp` or other secure methods to copy the `docker-compose.yml` file to each instance.

   ```bash
   scp -i path/to/your_private_key docker-compose.yml ubuntu@your_lightsail_ip:/home/ubuntu/
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   ssh -i path/to/your_private_key ubuntu@your_lightsail_ip
   cd /home/ubuntu/
   ```

3. **Start the Docker Compose Services:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   - The `-d` flag runs the containers in detached mode.

4. **Verify the Deployment:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```

   - Ensure all services are up and running.

5. **Automate Deployment (Optional):**

   For streamlined deployments, consider using deployment scripts or integrating with your CI/CD pipeline (covered in Section 4).

### 3.4 Managing Multi-Instance Deployments

In a microservices architecture, managing multiple instances requires careful orchestration to ensure seamless communication and scalability.

**Strategies:**

```

**Generating Logging API Code:**

Use GPT-based code generation (as covered in **Part B**) to create the Pydantic models, FastAPI endpoints, and SQLAlchemy models for the Logging API.

### 5.4 Integrating Logging with Kong API Gateway

Configure Kong to send logs to your custom Logging Service API.

**Steps:**

1. **Enable the `http-log` Plugin in Kong:**

   The `http-log` plugin sends request and response logs to a specified HTTP endpoint.

   **Example `kong.yml` Configuration:**

   ```yaml
   _format_version: '2.1'

   services:
     - name: central-sequence-service-v1
       url: http://central_sequence_service:8000/v1
       routes:
         - name: central-sequence-route-v1
           hosts:
             - centralsequence.fountain.coach
           paths:
             - /v1/sequence
           methods:
             - POST
             - GET
             - PUT
             - DELETE
           plugins:
             - name: http-log
               config:
                 http_endpoint: http://logging-service:5000/logs
                 timeout: 10000
                 keepalive: 60000

     # Repeat for other services...

   plugins:
     - name: rate-limiting
       service: central-sequence-service-v1
       config:
         minute: 1000
         hour: 5000

     # Repeat for other services...
   ```

2. **Apply the Configuration:**

   Use a deployment script or manual API calls to apply the updated configuration.

   **Example Shell Script: `configure_kong_logging.sh`**

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   set -e

   KONG_ADMIN_URL="http://localhost:8001"
   KONG_YML_PATH="./kong.yml"

   echo "Configuring Kong with custom logging..."

   # Apply declarative configuration
   curl -X POST "$KONG_ADMIN_URL/config" \
        -F "config=@$KONG_YML_PATH" \
        -F "replace=true"

   echo "Kong logging configuration applied successfully."
   ```

   **Instructions:**

   1. **Save the Script:**
      - Save the above script as `configure_kong_logging.sh` in your project directory.

   2. **Make the Script Executable:**
      ```bash
      chmod +x configure_kong_logging.sh
      ```

   3. **Run the Script:**
      ```bash
      ./configure_kong_logging.sh
      ```

3. **Verify Logging Configuration:**

   Ensure that Kong is successfully sending logs to the Logging Service API by checking the logs in the Logging Service.
