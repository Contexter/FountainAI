This chapter provides a **high-level blueprint** of how each component in the FountainAI ecosystem interacts, including:

1. [Key Management Service (KMS)](#key-management-service-kms)  
2. [API Gateway](#api-gateway)  
3. [FountainAI Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Service](#fountainai-two-factor-authentication-2fa-service)  
4. [Typesense Client Microservice](#typesense-client-microservice)  
5. [Service A](#service-a)  
6. [Caddy](#caddy)  
7. [Docker Compose](#docker-compose)  

By the end of this chapter, you should have a clear picture of how requests flow, where credentials and keys are stored, and how each service enhances security.

```

**Legend**:  
- **Caddy**: Handles secure TLS termination and routes user traffic to the API Gateway.  
- **API Gateway**: Validates JWTs, optionally checks 2FA status, then forwards requests to the relevant service.  
- **Key Management Service (KMS)**: Central authority for API key creation, JWT signing, and secret rotation.  
- **FountainAI Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Service**: Generates time-based OTPs and verifies them upon request.  
- **Typesense Client Microservice**: Interfaces with the Typesense search engine for indexing and searching.  
- **Service A**: Example domain-specific microservice performing sequence/version logic.  

---

## Key Management Service (KMS)

The **KMS** centralizes **API key** creation, storage, and rotation, ensuring a single source of truth for service-to-service credentials. It also issues **JWTs** for authenticated access. By delegating key management to a dedicated service:

- **Security**: Minimizes risk of key leakage or duplication.  
- **Simplicity**: Allows other services to request or validate keys without needing to store them locally.  
- **Scalability**: As the ecosystem grows, new services register with the KMS, obtaining keys and JWT signing details uniformly.

---

## API Gateway

All incoming client requests pass through the **API Gateway**, which:

1. **Validates JWT**: Checks token signatures, expiration, and claims (e.g., roles, audience).  
2. **2FA Integration**: When a high-privilege action is requested, the gateway may call the **2FA Service** to verify a one-time password.  
3. **Routing**: Directs requests to the correct backend service (e.g., **Service A**, **Typesense Client**).  
4. **Observability**: Provides a central point for logging, metrics collection, and rate limiting.

---

## FountainAI Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Service

The **2FA Service** significantly enhances user security by requiring a one-time password (OTP) in addition to JWT authentication. Key points:

- **Generates TOTPs**: Uses `pyotp` to generate codes.  
- **Time-Limited**: Enforces short lifespans for OTPs, typically 30–60 seconds or per config.  
- **Delivery**: Sends OTPs via email or SMS (Twilio), or any custom method.  
- **Verification**: Marks OTP logs as “used” once validated to prevent reuse.

Services in the ecosystem can call the 2FA Service on a **“to whom it may concern”** basis—only when extra security is needed.

---

## Typesense Client Microservice

This microservice acts as a **gateway** to the **Typesense** search engine. It:

- **Receives indexing operations** from various domain services (e.g., Service A).  
- **Performs search queries** on behalf of other services.  
- **Stores Typesense API Keys** from the KMS, ensuring consistent, secure communication with the search engine.

By centralizing “search logic” in one microservice, other services remain focused on domain logic rather than managing search infrastructure details.

---

## Service A

**Service A** is an example domain-focused microservice. In the **FountainAI** context, it might handle:

- **Sequence Management**: Generating sequence numbers for scripts, scenes, or other domain elements.  
- **Versioning**: Creating new versions of these elements.  
- **2FA Checking**: For privileged operations, it may call the 2FA Service to demand an OTP.  
- **Search Integration**: Through the **Typesense Client**, it updates or retrieves relevant documents from the search cluster.

---

## Caddy

**Caddy** is the outward-facing **reverse proxy** that handles:

- **TLS Termination**: Manages SSL certificates (often automatically via Let’s Encrypt).  
- **DNS Routing**: Directs traffic to the **API Gateway** using subdomains or paths.  
- **Security Headers**: Helps ensure HTTP security best practices (HSTS, etc.).

---

## Docker Compose

Finally, **Docker Compose** orchestrates all these containers and services. It provides:

- **Networking**: A shared virtual network for containers to communicate by name (e.g., `key_management_service:8003`).  
- **Volume Management**: Persists data for databases and certificates.  
- **Health Checks**: Ensures each service is running before dependent services start.

With Compose, developers can **spin up** or **tear down** the entire environment consistently across development, staging, and production.

## Next Steps

Proceed to **[3. Project Structure](./03_project_structure.md)** for an in-depth look at how we organize files and directories for each microservice (KMS, Gateway, 2FA Service, etc.), ensuring a clean, maintainable codebase.
