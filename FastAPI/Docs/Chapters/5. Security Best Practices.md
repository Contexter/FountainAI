Security is paramount in any microservices architecture, especially one handling sensitive data or user authentication. Below are key practices to consider across your **KMS**, **API Gateway**, **2FA**, and other FountainAI services.

---

## 1. Centralized Key Management

- **Single Source of Truth**: The Key Management Service (KMS) should be your authoritative source for issuing, rotating, and revoking API keys.  
- **Minimal Storage**: Other services should not store API keys locally; they only retrieve them when needed or rely on short-lived tokens.  
- **Automated Rotation**: Implement scheduled rotation of API keys to limit exposure if a key is ever compromised.

## 2. JWT Security

1. **Strong Secret Keys**  
   - Use long, random, high-entropy keys for signing JWTs (e.g., 32+ bytes).  
   - Never commit keys to source control; use environment variables or Docker Secrets.

2. **Token Expiration**  
   - Short-lived tokens reduce the window of vulnerability.  
   - Consider using refresh tokens for ongoing sessions.

3. **Claims Verification**  
   - Validate `iss` (issuer) and `aud` (audience) claims if your architecture requires it.  
   - Check `roles` or `permissions` claims for RBAC enforcement.

4. **HTTPS Everywhere**  
   - All JWTs should be transmitted over HTTPS to prevent interception.

## 3. FountainAI 2FA

1. **Time-Limited OTPs**  
   - Keep `OTP_EXPIRATION_MINUTES` low (e.g., 5 or less) to reduce exploitation windows.

2. **Secure Storage of Secrets**  
   - Encrypt user’s `otp_secret` if regulatory requirements demand it.  
   - Rate-limit OTP generation to prevent spam or brute force.

3. **Delivery Channels**  
   - For SMS, use **Twilio** or other reputable provider; secure your credentials.  
   - For email, configure **DKIM**, **SPF**, and **DMARC** to reduce phishing/spam vulnerabilities.

## 4. TLS & Network

1. **Caddy for Automatic TLS**  
   - Leverage Caddy’s built-in Let’s Encrypt integration for automatic certificate issuance and renewal.

2. **Isolate Services**  
   - Run each microservice on an **internal Docker network** inaccessible from the public internet.  
   - Expose only the necessary ports, typically via the API Gateway or Caddy.

3. **Firewall Rules**  
   - Use host-level firewalls (e.g., `ufw`) or cloud security groups to restrict access to internal ports.

## 5. Secret Management

1. **Environment Variables**  
   - Keep `.env` files out of source control.  
   - For production, consider storing secrets in Docker/Kubernetes Secrets or a dedicated store like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.

2. **Rotation**  
   - Rotate credentials (database passwords, Twilio tokens, etc.) periodically or after any suspected breach.

3. **Principle of Least Privilege**  
   - Each service should only have the credentials required to perform its tasks.  
   - If a service only needs read access to a database, don’t grant write permissions.

## 6. User Authentication & Authorization

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
   - Restrict admin-only endpoints.  
   - For example, only users with `roles` containing `"admin"` can rotate keys.

2. **2FA Enforcement**  
   - For critical operations (e.g., viewing sensitive data, rotating keys), require both a valid JWT **and** an OTP from the 2FA Service.

3. **Account Lockouts**  
   - Implement lockouts or cooldown periods after multiple failed login or OTP attempts.

---

## 7. Logging & Monitoring

1. **Structured Logging**  
   - Log in JSON format with relevant fields (timestamp, service name, log level, request ID).  
   - Avoid logging sensitive data (passwords, OTP codes, etc.).

2. **Centralized Log Aggregation**  
   - Aggregate logs using tools like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Grafana Loki.  
   - Helps detect anomalies across the entire ecosystem.

3. **Prometheus Metrics**  
   - Monitor metrics from all services (2FA usage, KMS key requests, API Gateway latencies) in Grafana.

4. **Alerts**  
   - Define alerts for unusual behavior (e.g., high 4xx/5xx error rates, repeated OTP failures).

---

## 8. Penetration Testing & Audits

1. **Regular Testing**  
   - Perform periodic penetration tests to identify vulnerabilities in the microservices, 2FA flows, or the gateway.  
   - Use scanning tools (e.g., **OWASP ZAP**) on your staging environment.

2. **GDPR/Compliance**  
   - If handling EU citizen data, ensure compliance with GDPR, especially around user data retention and breach notification.  
   - Provide clear user consents and manage the right to erasure if required.

3. **Threat Modeling**  
   - Analyze how an attacker might compromise a specific service or network link.  
   - Implement mitigations at each point (e.g., strong WAF rules on the gateway, hardened container images).

## 9. Summary

**Security** is an evolving process, not a one-time setup. By following these best practices—centralized key management, strong JWT/2FA usage, and thorough network isolation—FountainAI services remain both **flexible** and **secure**. Continuously audit, log, and monitor your services, rotating credentials and verifying your threat models to keep pace with new risks.
