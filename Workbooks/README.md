# Workbooks Directory

This directory contains the **Workbooks** for the FountainAI project. Each workbook provides detailed, step-by-step guides to help developers generate, modify, and deploy various components of the FountainAI system.

---

## Overview

The workbooks are designed to assist developers in:

- **Generating code** using OpenAI's GPT-4 via the OpenAI API.
- **Modifying code** to adhere to FountainAI norms and best practices.
- **Automating tasks** using shell scripts following FountainAI guidelines.
- **Deploying services** to platforms like AWS using CLI tools.
- **Testing and validating** the deployed applications.

## Workbook Format

Each workbook in this directory follows a consistent format to ensure clarity and ease of use. The format includes:

1. **Title**: Clearly states the purpose of the workbook.
2. **Introduction**: Provides an overview of what the workbook covers.
3. **Prerequisites**: Lists the tools, access, and knowledge required.
4. **Project Setup**: Guides on setting up the environment.
5. **Detailed Steps**: Breaks down the process into manageable steps.
6. **Prompts and Expected Responses**: Includes static prompts used with GPT-4 and the expected outputs.
7. **Shell Scripts**: Provides scripts to automate code modifications and deployments.
8. **Reference Tables**: Summarizes key steps, commands, and actions for quick reference.
9. **Conclusion**: Summarizes what was accomplished.
10. **Next Steps**: Suggests further actions or enhancements.

### Scripted Dialogue Format

The workbooks utilize a **Scripted Dialogue Format** to interact with GPT-4. This format includes:

- **Static Prompts**: Predefined prompts that can be reused and adapted.
- **Expected GPT-4 Responses**: Sample outputs from the model based on the prompts.
- **Code Blocks**: Code snippets provided by GPT-4, formatted with appropriate language identifiers.
- **Notes/Actions**: Additional information or instructions related to the prompts and responses.

#### Benefits of the Format

- **Consistency**: Ensures all workbooks maintain the same structure.
- **Clarity**: Makes it easy to follow along and understand each step.
- **Reusability**: Allows developers to reuse prompts and scripts in other contexts.
- **Efficiency**: Streamlines the development and deployment process.
