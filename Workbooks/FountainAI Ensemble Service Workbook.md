## **1. Introduction**

The **FountainAI Ensemble Service** is a core component of the **FountainAI ecosystem**, facilitating structured interaction between the **user**, the **OpenAI Assistant SDK (The Assistant)**, and various **FountainAI services**. By leveraging an **OpenAPI-first approach**, this service dynamically generates system prompts based on the OpenAPI specifications of each integrated service.

The primary roles of the Ensemble Service include:

- **Orchestrating dialogue** between users and services through the Assistant.
- **Generating dynamic system prompts** that guide these interactions.
- **Maintaining logs** of user queries, Assistant responses, and service interactions for transparency and traceability.

This workbook provides an overview of the design, key features, and detailed implementation strategy for the **FountainAI Ensemble Service**.

---

## **2. Objectives and Scope**

### **2.1 Key Objectives**

- **System Prompt Generation**: Dynamically generate system prompts using OpenAPI definitions of the FountainAI services.
- **Service Interaction Management**: Orchestrate user inputs, Assistant responses, and interactions with various FountainAI services.
- **Interaction Logging**: Log every interaction to ensure visibility into how user queries are processed by the Assistant and FountainAI services.

### **2.2 Scope of the Service**

The FountainAI Ensemble Service is designed for both **local deployment** (for testing and development) and **cloud-based operations**. It manages queries, processes responses, and coordinates service interactions, allowing for easy updates as new services are added to the ecosystem.

---

## **3. Architecture and Design**

### **3.1 System Overview**

The FountainAI Ensemble Service functions as a middle layer between:

- **Users**: Who submit queries.
- **The Assistant (GPT model)**: Which processes user queries and generates responses.
- **FountainAI Services**: Which provide data and operations needed for responses.

### **3.2 Key Components**

- **System Prompt Factory**: Combines OpenAPI definitions from multiple services to create a unified system prompt that guides the Assistantâ€™s behavior.
- **FastAPI Application**: Provides endpoints for user queries, system prompt generation, and interaction management.
- **Logging System**: Captures detailed logs of interactions between users, the Assistant, and services.

### **3.3 Dynamic Orchestration**

The service dynamically generates prompts based on which services are active and required during a session, ensuring that the Assistant can interact effectively with each service based on its OpenAPI definition.

---

## **4. OpenAPI-First Approach**

The OpenAPI-first approach ensures that the Assistant can dynamically parse and understand the API specifications of each integrated service. Since OpenAPI definitions are machine-readable by nature, they provide the Assistant with the comprehensive details needed to reason about the available operations and construct appropriate requests accordingly. By using OpenAPI, the Assistant is expected to:

- **Parse and Integrate Definitions**: Automatically parse the OpenAPI specifications to understand all endpoints, parameters, request types, and response formats. This gives the Assistant a complete understanding of each service.
- **Contextual Awareness of Dependencies**: Infer dependencies between services in real time. For example, if storing a script requires generating sequence numbers first, the Assistant should dynamically understand and respect this dependency.
- **Automated Validation**: Validate each constructed request against the provided OpenAPI schema to ensure it is correctly formatted before executing the request. If validation fails, the Assistant should adjust its request accordingly.
- **Dynamic Request Construction**: Based on user input, the Assistant constructs correct API requests, including handling dependencies such as generating sequence numbers, creating or updating entities, and managing interdependent service calls. This minimizes errors related to incorrect request structures or missing data.
- **Dynamic Workflow Inference**: The Assistant should dynamically infer the sequence of API interactions needed by parsing OpenAPI definitions in real time. This approach enables the Assistant to adapt to different user requests, reason about dependencies, and construct workflows without predefined limitations, thereby maintaining flexibility and ensuring context-aware operations.
