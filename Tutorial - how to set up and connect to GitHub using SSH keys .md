Here's a definitive tutorial script on how to set up and connect to GitHub using SSH keys from your local machine. This script will guide you through the steps required to configure SSH keys, add them to your GitHub account, and use SSH for Git operations, all with comprehensive comments for better understanding.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Step 1: Check for SSH Keys
echo "Checking for existing SSH keys..."
if [ -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 ]; then
    echo "SSH key already exists."
else
    # Step 2: Generate a New SSH Key
    echo "No SSH key found. Generating a new SSH key..."
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com" -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -N ""
    echo "New SSH key generated."
fi

# Step 3: Start the SSH Agent and Add Key
echo "Starting the SSH agent..."
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
echo "Adding the SSH key to the SSH agent..."
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# Step 4: Copy SSH Key to Clipboard for GitHub
echo "Copying SSH public key to clipboard..."
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | xclip -selection clipboard

echo "SSH public key copied to clipboard. Please add this key to your GitHub account."
echo "Visit GitHub -> Settings -> SSH and GPG keys -> New SSH key."

# Pause for user action
read -p "Press [Enter] key after you've added the key to your GitHub account..."

# Step 5: Test SSH connection
echo "Testing SSH connection to GitHub..."
ssh -T git@github.com

# If connection is successful, configure Git to use SSH
if [ $? -eq 1 ]; then
    echo "SSH connection established. Configuring Git to use SSH..."
    git config --global url."git@github.com:".insteadOf "https://github.com/"

    # Step 6: Change remote URL to use SSH (change 'username' and 'repo' accordingly)
    echo "Changing Git remote URL to use SSH..."
    git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repo.git

    echo "Git is now configured to use SSH for GitHub operations."
else
    echo "Failed to establish an SSH connection to GitHub."
fi
```

### Explanation of Each Step:
1. **Check Existing SSH Keys**: Looks for an existing SSH key pair in the default location. If it finds one, it skips generating a new key.
2. **Generate SSH Key**: Creates a new SSH key using the specified email as a label.
3. **Start SSH Agent and Add Key**: Ensures the SSH agent is running and adds the SSH key to it.
4. **Copy SSH Key to Clipboard**: Copies the SSH public key to your clipboard for easy pasting into GitHub.
5. **Test SSH Connection**: Attempts to establish an SSH connection to GitHub to confirm everything is set up correctly.
6. **Configure Git**: Changes the Git configuration to use SSH instead of HTTPS for connections to GitHub.

This script assumes you have `xclip` installed for copying the SSH key to the clipboard (useful on many Linux distributions). Adjust the script to use `pbcopy` on macOS or equivalent in other environments. Make sure to replace `"your_email@example.com"`, `"username"`, and `"repo"` with your actual email, GitHub username, and repository name.
