The message "Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy" in Git refers to the merging strategy used to combine two branches. In Git, when you perform a merge, you often need to decide how the histories of these branches will be brought together. This decision is determined by the merging strategy.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what it means:

### Merge Strategies

Git provides several strategies for merging branches. The most commonly used strategies are:

1. **Recursive**: This is the default merging strategy when merging two branches that have diverged. When you execute a merge and Git detects that both branches have made changes, it uses the recursive strategy. This strategy involves:

   - Identifying a common base commit between the two branches.
   - Analyzing the changes from the common base to each branch's current commit.
   - Attempting to automatically combine these changes (or changesets). This may involve combining lines or resolving conflicts where the same parts of files have been changed differently on each branch.

2. **Resolve**: Used in simpler cases where there is a clean lineage of commit history, without the complexities of diverging and converging paths that require recursive resolution.

3. **Octopus**: Used for merging more than two branches at once.

4. **Ours** and **Theirs**: These are used to favor changes from one specific branch either exclusively or in conflicted parts only.

### How Recursive Strategy Works

In the "recursive" strategy, Git starts by looking for the most recent common ancestor of the branches being merged. It then generates a combined commit if there are no conflicts, or it will prompt the user to resolve conflicts manually if the automatic merge isn't possible. The recursive strategy is powerful because it can handle complex histories by creating a new commit that represents the merged state of the two branches.

### Practical Implication

In your case, when you pulled changes from the `origin/main` branch into your local `main` branch, Git detected that both branches had diverged from their last common ancestor. It then automatically merged the changes using the recursive strategy, integrating the changes from the remote repository into your local repository while keeping your local changes intact, provided there were no conflicts requiring manual resolution.

This process resulted in a new commit on your local branch that effectively combines the history and changes from both sources. The new files `03_add_vhost.sh` and `Server VHost Configuration Script Guide.md` were added as part of this merge, indicating successful integration of changes from the remote `main` branch into your local branch.
