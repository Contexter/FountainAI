### Documentation for Patch 5

#### Introduction

The `5_patch.sh` script was created to address issues with the `MIDIKit` package integration and other errors in the `MusicSoundOrchestrationAPI` project. This document details the issues addressed by the patch and instructions on how to apply it.

#### Issues Addressed

1. **Non-Conformance to Decodable and Encodable Protocols:**
   - The `GenerateMIDIFileRequest` structure did not conform to the `Decodable` and `Encodable` protocols because the `[MIDIEvent]` type does not conform to these protocols.

2. **Unresolved Identifiers and Methods:**
   - The `GenerateMIDIFileController.swift` file had multiple issues with unresolved identifiers and methods related to `MIDIEvent`, `MIDIFileTrack`, and other MIDI-related elements.

3. **Route and Method Errors:**
   - The `routes.swift` file contained references to functions that were not in scope, causing build errors.

#### Changes Made

1. **Manual Implementation of Codable:**
   - Implemented custom `init(from decoder: Decoder)` and `encode(to encoder: Encoder)` methods for the `GenerateMIDIFileRequest` structure to manually handle the `[MIDIEvent]` array.

2. **Resolved Identifier Issues:**
   - Fixed unresolved identifiers and methods in `GenerateMIDIFileController.swift` by ensuring correct references and initialization of MIDI-related elements.

3. **Fixed Routes and Methods:**
   - Corrected the function references in `routes.swift` to ensure they are in scope and correctly defined.

#### How to Apply the Patch

1. Save the `5_patch.sh` script to the root directory of your project.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of your project.
3. Run the script using the following command:

```sh
chmod +x 5_patch.sh
./5_patch.sh
```

4. After applying the patch, run the build command again:

```sh
swift build
```

#### Commit Message

```
