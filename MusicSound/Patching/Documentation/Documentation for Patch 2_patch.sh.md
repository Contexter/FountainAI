# Documentation for Patch 2_patch.sh

## Introduction

The patch script `2_patch.sh` is created to include the `MIDIKit` package in the `MusicSoundOrchestrationAPI` project and to correct the usage of `MIDIKit` in `GenerateMIDIFileController.swift`. This document provides detailed information about the changes made by the patch and instructions on how to apply it.

## Issues Addressed

The following issues are addressed by the patch:

1. **Missing MIDIKit Dependency:**
   - The `MIDIKit` package was not included in the project's dependencies, causing build errors when trying to use MIDI-related functionality.

2. **Incorrect Usage of MIDIKit:**
   - The `GenerateMIDIFileController.swift` file contained references to `MIDIKit` that were not properly imported or used, leading to build errors.

## Patch Details

The patch script performs the following actions:

1. **Update `Package.swift`:**
   - Adds the `MIDIKit` dependency with the correct version tag `0.9.6`.

2. **Update `GenerateMIDIFileController.swift`:**
   - Ensures that the correct import statements and usage of `MIDIKit` are present.

## Instructions to Apply the Patch

1. **Save the Script:**
   - Save the script content provided above as `2_patch.sh` in the root directory of your project (`MusicSoundOrchestrationAPI`).

2. **Make the Script Executable:**
   - Run the following command to make the script executable:
     ```bash
     chmod +x 2_patch.sh
     ```

3. **Run the Script:**
   - Execute the script to apply the patches:
     ```bash
     ./2_patch.sh
     ```

4. **Update Dependencies:**
   - Update the Swift package dependencies to fetch the `MIDIKit` package:
     ```bash
     swift package update
     ```

5. **Rebuild the Project:**
   - After applying the patch and updating the dependencies, rebuild the project to ensure the issues are resolved:
     ```bash
     swift build
     ```

## Conclusion

The patch script `2_patch.sh` effectively includes the `MIDIKit` package in the `MusicSoundOrchestrationAPI` project and corrects the usage of `MIDIKit` in `GenerateMIDIFileController.swift`. Follow the provided instructions to apply the patch and successfully build the project.
