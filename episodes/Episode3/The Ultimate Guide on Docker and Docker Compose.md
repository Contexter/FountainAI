   This command will display the installed version of Docker Compose if the installation was successful.

## Understanding Docker

Docker uses a client-server architecture to manage and run containers. Understanding the architecture and basic commands is crucial for effectively using Docker.

### Docker Architecture

Docker comprises several components:

- **Docker Client**: The interface through which users interact with Docker.
- **Docker Daemon**: Runs on the host machine and manages Docker objects like images, containers, networks, and volumes.
- **Docker Registry**: Stores Docker images. Docker Hub is a public registry, but private registries can also be used.

### Basic Docker Commands

Here are some basic Docker commands to get you started:

- **Run a Docker Container**:
  ```sh
  docker run hello-world
  ```
  This command runs a container using the `hello-world` image.

- **List Docker Containers**:
  ```sh
  docker ps
  docker ps -a  # List all containers, including stopped ones
  ```
  These commands list running containers and all containers respectively.

- **Stop a Docker Container**:
  ```sh
  docker stop <container_id>
  ```
  This command stops a running container.

- **Remove a Docker Container**:
  ```sh
  docker rm <container_id>
  ```
  This command removes a container.

- **List Docker Images**:
  ```sh
  docker images
  ```
  This command lists all Docker images on your machine.

- **Remove a Docker Image**:
  ```sh
  docker rmi <image_id>
  ```
  This command removes an image.

## Understanding Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool that simplifies the process of managing multi-container Docker applications. It uses a YAML file to define and run multi-container applications. With Docker Compose, you can manage the entire lifecycle of your application services, including starting, stopping, and rebuilding services.

### Docker Compose Architecture

Docker Compose uses a single file, typically named `docker-compose.yml`, to configure your application's services, networks, and volumes. This file describes the services that make up your application, their configurations, and how they interact with each other.

- **Services**: Different components of your application, each running in its own container.
- **Networks**: Configurations that define how services communicate with each other.
- **Volumes**: Persistent storage for your containers.

### Basic Docker Compose Commands

Here are some basic Docker Compose commands to manage your multi-container applications:

- **Start Services**:
  ```sh
  docker-compose up
  ```
  This command starts all the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

- **Start Services in Detached Mode**:
  ```sh
  docker-compose up -d
  ```
  This command starts the services in the background (detached mode).

- **Stop Services**:
  ```sh
  docker-compose down
  ```
  This command stops and removes all the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

- **View Service Logs**:
  ```sh
  docker-compose logs
  ```
  This command displays logs from the running services.

- **List Containers**:
  ```sh
  docker-compose ps
  ```
  This command lists all containers managed by Docker Compose.

## Creating and Running Docker Containers

To create and run Docker containers, you need to write a Dockerfile, build the image, and run the container. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1. **Create a Dockerfile**:
   A Dockerfile defines the environment and instructions for building a Docker image. Here’s an example Dockerfile for a simple Python application:
   
   ```Dockerfile
   # Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
   FROM python:3.8-slim

   # Set the working directory in the container
   WORKDIR /app

   # Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
   COPY . /app

   # Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
   RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

   # Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
   EXPOSE 80

   # Define environment variable
   ENV NAME World

   # Run app.py when the container launches
   CMD ["python", "app.py"]
   ```

2. **Build the Docker Image**:
   Build the Docker image from your Dockerfile using the following command:
   ```sh
   docker build -t my-python-app .
   ```

3. **Run the Docker Container**:
   Run the Docker container using the built image with the following command:
   ```sh
   docker run -p 4000:80 my-python-app
   ```

## Creating and Running Multi-Container Applications with Docker Compose

Docker Compose simplifies running multi-container applications by using a single YAML file to define and manage all the services. Here’s how you can create and run a multi-container application using Docker Compose:

1. **Create a `docker-compose.yml` File**:
   Define your multi-container application in a `docker-compose.yml` file. Here’s an example:
   
   ```yaml
   version: '3'
   services:
     web:
       image: my-python-app
       build: .
       ports:
         - "4000:80"
       volumes:
         - .:/code
       environment:
         - FLASK_ENV=development
     redis:
       image: "redis:alpine"
   ```

2. **Start the Application**:
   Start your multi-container application using the following command:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up
   ```

3. **Stop the Application**:
   Stop and remove your application services using the following command:
   ```sh
   docker-compose down
   ```

## Using GitHub's Container Registry

GitHub's Container Registry allows you to store and manage Docker images within your GitHub repositories. This section will guide you through pushing and pulling images to and from GitHub's Container Registry. 

### Preparing GitHub for Container Registry

1. **Create a Personal Access Token (PAT)**:
   - Go to [GitHub settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
   - Click on **Generate new token**.
   - Give your token a descriptive name.
   - Select the `write:packages`, `read:packages`, and `delete:packages` scopes.
   - Click **Generate token**.
   - Copy the token and store it securely.

### Pushing Images to GitHub's Container Registry

1. **Authenticate Docker to GitHub Packages**:
   Open your terminal and authenticate Docker to GitHub Packages using your PAT:
   ```sh
   echo YOUR_GITHUB_PAT | docker login ghcr.io -u YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME --password-stdin
   ```
   Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_PAT` with your personal access token and `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

2. **Tag Your Docker Image**:
   Tag your Docker image with the GitHub Container Registry URL:
   ```sh
   docker tag my-python-app ghcr.io/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/my-python-app:latest
   ```
   Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

3. **Push the Docker Image**:
   Push the tagged image to GitHub Container Registry:
   ```sh
   docker push ghcr.io/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/my-python-app:latest
   ```

### Pulling Images from GitHub's Container Registry

1. **Authenticate Docker to GitHub Packages** (if not already authenticated):
   Authenticate Docker to GitHub Packages using your PAT:
   ```sh
   echo YOUR_GITHUB_PAT | docker login ghcr.io -u YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME --password-stdin
   ```
   Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_PAT` with your personal access token and `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

2. **Pull the Docker Image**:
   Pull the image from GitHub Container Registry:
   ```sh
   docker pull ghcr.io/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/my-python-app:latest
   ```
   Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

3. **Run the Docker Container**:
   Run the pulled Docker image:
   ```sh
