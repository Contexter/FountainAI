### Introduction

In the previous episode, we decoupled our CI/CD pipeline and centralized the management of secrets using a custom Swift-based command-line tool. This ensured that sensitive information is securely stored and seamlessly integrated into our deployment process. 

In this episode, we will take a significant leap forward by leveraging GPT-4o to generate a full-stack Vapor application and an accompanying CI/CD pipeline. The GPT-4o model will use the provided OpenAPI specification to produce all necessary code components, streamlining our development workflow and enhancing productivity.

### Recap of Episode 4

In Episode 4, we:
- Created a Swift-based command-line tool for managing GitHub secrets.
- Dockerized the tool and integrated it into our CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
- Streamlined the deployment process by automating the management of sensitive information.

### Leveraging GPT-4o for Code Generation

GPT-4o is a powerful language model capable of generating high-quality code based on provided specifications and instructions. By utilizing GPT-4o, we can automate the creation of a comprehensive Vapor application and its CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that all necessary components are correctly implemented and integrated.

### Prompt Engineering for Vapor Application

To generate a full-stack Vapor application, we need to provide GPT-4 with a detailed prompt that includes:
- A placeholder for the OpenAPI specification.
- Instructions to create models, controllers, and migrations based on the OpenAPI schema.
- Guidance on implementing routes, validation, and error handling.
- Details on using Redis for caching where applicable.

### Prompt Engineering for CI/CD Pipeline

For the CI/CD pipeline, the prompt should include:
- Instructions to set up GitHub Actions workflows for building, testing, and deploying the application.
- Steps for environment setup, including PostgreSQL and Redis.
- Integration of the previously created secrets manager command-line tool.
- Details on running database migrations as part of the deployment process.

### The Comprehensive Prompt

Here is the comprehensive prompt for GPT-4o:

---

**START OF PROMPT**


You are a highly capable AI trained to assist with software development. Given the following OpenAPI specification, generate a fully functional Vapor application in Swift. The code must be fully commented. Also, integrate a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, leveraging the secrets manager command-line tool previously created. The code must be provided in executable shell scripts that again produce the code correctly integrated into the FountainAI repository.

**OpenAPI Specification Placeholder:**
 (Include here the full OpenAPI specification from [FountainAI-Admin-openAPI.yaml](https://github.com/Contexter/fountainAI/blob/staging/openAPI/FountainAI-Admin-openAPI.yaml))

**Task:**

1. **Vapor Application:**
   - Create models, controllers, and migrations based on the OpenAPI specification.
   - Ensure all routes and endpoints are implemented as specified.
   - Use Redis for caching where applicable.
   - Implement validation and error handling as per the specification.
   - Ensure all models such as `Script`, `SectionHeading`, `Action`, `Character`, `SpokenWord`, `Transition`, `Paraphrase` are defined according to the schema provided in the OpenAPI.
   - Implement controllers for handling CRUD operations on these models.
   - Create migrations for setting up the database schema.

2. **CI/CD Pipeline:**
   - Set up GitHub Actions workflows for building, testing, and deploying the application.
   - Use the secrets manager command-line tool to manage secrets securely.
   - Ensure the pipeline includes steps for environment setup, running tests, building Docker images, and deploying to a specified environment.
   - The environment setup should include PostgreSQL, Redis, and any other services mentioned in the OpenAPI.
   - Include steps for running database migrations as part of the deployment process.

3. **Executable Shell Scripts:**
   - Provide the code in executable shell scripts that will produce the code correctly integrated into the FountainAI repository.
   - Ensure the scripts set up the project structure, create necessary files, and commit changes to the repository.
   - Scripts should include setup for directories, environment configuration, and integration with Docker Compose.

4. **Comments and Documentation:**
   - Provide comprehensive comments and documentation within the code to explain the implementation details.

### Example Shell Scripts:

**setup_project_structure.sh**
```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Ensure we're in the root directory of the existing repository
cd /path/to/your/fountainAI

# Create necessary directories for controllers, models, migrations, and tests
mkdir -p Sources/App/Controllers
mkdir -p Sources/App/Models
mkdir -p Sources/App/Migrations
mkdir -p Tests/AppTests

echo "Project structure setup complete."

# Commit the changes to the repository
git add Sources/App Tests/AppTests
git commit -m "Set up initial project structure"
git push origin development
```

**create_models.sh**
```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Navigate to the Models directory

import Vapor

final class Script: Model, Content {
    static let schema = "scripts"

    @ID(key: .id)
    var id: UUID?

    @Field(key: "title")
    var title: String

    @Field(key: "description")
    var description: String

    @Field(key: "author")
    var author: String

    @Field(key: "sequence")
    var sequence: Int

    init() {}

    init(id: UUID? = nil, title: String, description: String, author: String, sequence: Int) {
        self.id = id
        self.title = title
        self.description = description
        self.author = author
        self.sequence = sequence
    }

            }
    }

    func delete(req: Request) throws -> EventLoopFuture<HTTPStatus> {
        return Script.find(req.parameters.get("scriptID"), on: req.db)
            .unwrap(or: Abort(.notFound))
            .flatMap { script in

**END OF PROMPT**

### Generating and Testing the generated Code

1. **Run the Scripts**: Execute each shell script in the given order to set up the project structure, create models, controllers, migrations, and CI/CD workflows.
2. **Verify Integration**: Ensure that the generated code is correctly integrated into the FountainAI repository.
3. **Run the CI/CD Pipeline**: Push changes to the repository and monitor the CI/CD pipeline to verify successful builds, tests, and deployments.

### Guide for Using the Prompt

To efficiently use the prompt with GPT-4o:

1. **Prepare the OpenAPI Specification**: Ensure the full OpenAPI specification is available and correctly formatted.
2. **Create a New Markdown File**: Save the comprehensive prompt (from START OF PROMPT to END OF PROMPT) into a new `.md` file, including the placeholder for the OpenAPI specification.
3. **Insert the OpenAPI Specification**: Replace the placeholder with the actual OpenAPI specification from [FountainAI-Admin-openAPI.yaml](https://github.com/Contexter/fountainAI/blob/staging/openAPI/FountainAI-Admin-openAPI.yaml).
4. **Copy the Markdown File Content**: Select all the content of this newly created `.md` file and copy it.
5. **Paste into ChatGPT**: Open ChatGPT, verify GPT-4o model use and paste the copied content as a prompt.
6. **Run the Prompt**: Execute the prompt and review the generated code.
7. **Run the Shell Scripts**: Save the generated shell scripts and run them to implement the Vapor application and CI/CD pipeline.

### Conclusion

In this episode, we leveraged GPT-4 to automate the generation of a full-stack Vapor application and its CI/CD pipeline based on the provided OpenAPI specification. By creating a comprehensive prompt and generating executable shell scripts, we streamlined the development process and ensured seamless integration into our existing repository.

This approach not only saves time but also reduces the risk of errors, enabling us to focus on further enhancing the application and its features. Stay tuned for the next episodes, where we will continue to build upon this foundation, implementing more complex features and refining our development workflow.
