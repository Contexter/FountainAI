# Secure Token Generation Using Basic Authentication: A Practical Guide

## Abstract

This paper discusses the implementation of a secure token generation mechanism using basic authentication within a Vapor-based web application. It details the authentication process, the role of runtime-injected GitHub secrets, and provides practical examples using cURL commands to demonstrate how clients can interact with the token generation endpoint securely.

## Introduction

Token-based authentication is a widely used method for securing APIs, providing a way to ensure that only authorized users can access certain endpoints. This paper focuses on implementing a secure token generation endpoint using basic authentication and JWT (JSON Web Token) in a Vapor application. The authentication credentials are managed securely using GitHub secrets, ensuring that sensitive information is not exposed.

## Security of the Token Generation Route

### Runtime Injection of Credentials

When using GitHub secrets to manage authentication credentials, these credentials are injected into the application environment at runtime. This approach ensures that sensitive information, such as usernames and passwords, is not hard-coded in the source code but securely managed through the deployment environment.

### Continuous Authentication

The token generation route is protected by basic authentication, which checks the provided credentials against the values stored in environment variables. This process ensures that the route is only accessible to clients that provide the correct username and password.

## Detailed Authentication Process

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Request Submission**: The client sends an HTTP request to the `/generate-token` route with the `Authorization` header containing the base64-encoded credentials.
2. **Basic Authentication Middleware**: The middleware intercepts the request, decodes the `Authorization` header, and compares the credentials against the environment variables.
3. **Credential Validation**: If the credentials match, the request proceeds to the token generation handler. If not, a `401 Unauthorized` status code is returned.
4. **Token Generation**: The handler creates a JWT payload, signs it, and returns the token in the response.

### Example Workflow with cURL Commands

#### Successful Token Generation

To generate a token, the client must provide the correct credentials:

```bash
curl -X GET https://your-vapor-app.com/generate-token \
     -H "Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46cGFzc3dvcmQ="
```

- **Authorization Header**: `Basic YWRtaW46cGFzc3dvcmQ=` is the base64-encoded form of `admin:password`.

**Expected Response**:

```json
{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
}
```

#### Failed Token Generation (Missing Credentials)

If the credentials are not provided, the request will be denied:

```bash
curl -X GET https://your-vapor-app.com/generate-token
```

**Expected Response**:

```http
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
```

## Practical Implementation in Vapor

### Basic Authentication Middleware

The following middleware ensures that requests to the token generation route are authenticated:

```swift
struct BasicAuthMiddleware: Middleware {
    func respond(to request: Request, chainingTo next: Responder) -> EventLoopFuture<Response> {
        guard let authHeader = request.headers.basicAuthorization else {
            return request.eventLoop.makeFailedFuture(Abort(.unauthorized))
        }

        let expectedUsername = Environment.get("BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME") ?? "admin"
        let expectedPassword = Environment.get("BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD") ?? "password"

        if authHeader.username == expectedUsername && authHeader.password == expectedPassword {
            return next.respond(to: request)
        } else {
            return request.eventLoop.makeFailedFuture(Abort(.unauthorized))
        }
    }
}
```

### Token Generation Handler

The handler for the `/generate-token` route creates and returns a JWT token:

```swift
app.grouped(BasicAuthMiddleware()).get("generate-token") { req -> String in
    let payload = MyPayload(sub: .init(value: "user123"), exp: .init(value: .distantFuture))
    let token = try req.jwt.sign(payload)
    return token
}
```

### Configuration with Environment Variables

The credentials and JWT secret are managed through environment variables, ensuring they are securely injected at runtime:

```swift
public func configure(_ app: Application) throws {
    guard let jwtSecret = Environment.get("JWT_SECRET"),
          let githubToken = Environment.get("GITHUB_TOKEN"),
          let basicAuthUsername = Environment.get("BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME"),
          let basicAuthPassword = Environment.get("BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD") else {
        fatalError("Missing required environment variables")
    }

    let signers = JWTSigners()
    try signers.use(.hs256(key: jwtSecret))
    app.jwt.signers = signers
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Strong Credentials

Ensure the username and password are strong and not easily guessable. Use complex passwords and manage them securely.

### Secure Environment Management

Store credentials securely using GitHub secrets and ensure that environment variables are not exposed in logs or error messages.

### Additional Security Measures

Consider implementing additional measures such as IP whitelisting, rate limiting, and monitoring to further secure the token generation route.

## Conclusion

By using runtime-injected credentials for basic authentication, we can secure the token generation route in a Vapor application effectively. This approach ensures that sensitive credentials are managed securely and not hard-coded in the source code. Implementing strong credentials and additional security measures further enhances the protection of the token generation endpoint.
