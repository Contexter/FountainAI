# **Dynamic OpenAPI-Driven Application Framework for FountainAI Microservices**

This document outlines the concept and implementation plan for building a **Dynamic OpenAPI-Driven Application Framework** using **Vapor** and **OpenAPIKit**, enabling minimal-effort development of FountainAI microservices.

---

## **Concept**

The idea is to treat the OpenAPI specification as the **single source of truth** for application behavior. The framework will dynamically configure the application at runtime based on the parsed OpenAPI document. This approach minimizes manual coding, ensures strict adherence to the spec, and enables seamless evolution of services by simply updating the OpenAPI document.

### **Key Objectives**
1. **Dynamic Configuration**: Automatically generate routes, request/response validation, and error handling based on the OpenAPI spec.
2. **Spec Compliance**: Ensure the application adheres to the spec at runtime.
3. **Reusability**: Provide reusable components (e.g., validators, middleware) for consistent implementation across FountainAI microservices.
4. **Ease of Use**: Developers focus on writing the OpenAPI spec, while the framework handles app generation.

---

## **Core Components**

### **1. OpenAPI Parsing**
- **Library**: Use **OpenAPIKit** to parse the OpenAPI spec (`central-sequence-service.yml`) at startup.
- **Parsed Data**: Extract paths, methods, schemas, parameters, and responses from the spec.

---

### **2. Dynamic Route Registration**
- **Routes Factory**: Dynamically register routes based on `paths` and `operations` in the OpenAPI spec.
- **Handlers**: Map each operation to a handler function.
  - **Default Handler**: Provide a default handler that validates requests/responses dynamically.
  - **Custom Logic**: Allow developers to override default handlers.

---

### **3. Validation Middleware**
- **Path and Method Validation**: Ensure the request matches the allowed paths and methods.
- **Request Body Validation**: Validate the request payload against the OpenAPI-defined schema.
- **Response Validation**: Ensure responses conform to the OpenAPI schema.

---

### **4. Error Handling**
- **Dynamic Errors**: Generate error responses based on the `default` response or operation-specific responses in the OpenAPI spec.
- **Standardized Error Format**: Ensure consistency across services.

---

### **5. Shared Utilities**
- **Schema Validators**: Utility to validate payloads against OpenAPI schemas.
- **Spec Updater**: Tool to reload the app with a new spec without downtime.
- **OpenAPI Contract Tester**: Automate testing against the spec for contract compliance.

---

### **6. Reusability**
- Package the dynamic configuration logic into a reusable module (`FountainOpenAPIFramework`) for integration across FountainAI microservices.

## **Implementation Plan**

### **Phase 1: Core Framework Development**

#### **1. OpenAPI Spec Parsing**
- **Objective**: Parse the OpenAPI spec into an in-memory representation using OpenAPIKit.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Load `central-sequence-service.yml` during app initialization.
  2. Parse the spec into `OpenAPI.Document`.
  3. Extract:
     - Paths and operations (`openAPISpec.paths`).
     - Schemas (`openAPISpec.components.schemas`).
     - Request bodies, parameters, and responses.

---

#### **2. Dynamic Route Registration**
- **Objective**: Register routes dynamically based on the parsed OpenAPI paths and methods.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Iterate through `openAPISpec.paths`.
  2. For each path and method, register a Vapor route:
     ```swift
     app.on(method, path, use: generateHandler(for: operation))
     ```
  3. Implement a `generateHandler` function:
     - Validate incoming requests.
     - Call user-defined or default logic.
     - Validate outgoing responses.

---

#### **3. Validation Middleware**
- **Objective**: Enforce validation for paths, methods, request bodies, and query parameters.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Create middleware for path and method validation:
     - Match the request path and method against the spec.
  2. Implement request body validation:
     - Extract schema from the spec.
     - Validate the payload using the schema.
  3. Add response validation:
     - Validate outgoing responses against the response schema.

---

#### **4. Error Handling**
- **Objective**: Provide dynamic error responses based on the OpenAPI spec.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Define a standardized error format (e.g., `FountainError`).
  2. Generate error responses dynamically:
     - Use `default` responses in the spec if available.
     - Fall back to a generic error if unspecified.
  3. Integrate error handling middleware.

---

#### **5. Reusable Components**
- **Objective**: Package shared logic into a reusable module.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Extract route registration, validation, and error handling into a reusable `FountainOpenAPIFramework`.
  2. Provide configuration options to override default behavior.

---

### **Phase 2: Feature Expansion**

#### **6. Request/Response Enhancements**
- Support advanced OpenAPI features like:
  - Query parameter validation.
  - Content negotiation based on `Accept` headers.
  - Multiple response formats.

#### **7. Schema Extensions**
- Allow developers to extend or override OpenAPI-defined schemas for specific use cases.

---

### **Phase 3: Deployment and Testing**

#### **8. Automated Testing**
- **Objective**: Ensure the app conforms to the OpenAPI spec.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Integrate tools like **Dredd** or Postman to run contract tests against the spec.
  2. Automate spec compliance testing in CI/CD pipelines.

---

#### **9. Deployment Workflow**
- **Objective**: Enable seamless deployment with spec updates.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Create a CLI tool for spec validation and deployment:
     ```bash
     fountain-cli deploy --spec central-sequence-service.yml
     ```
  2. Support hot reloading of the spec without downtime.

---

## **Deliverables**

1. **FountainOpenAPIFramework**:
   - A Swift module for dynamic OpenAPI-driven configuration in Vapor.

2. **Generated Microservices**:
   - Fully functional FountainAI microservices dynamically configured from OpenAPI specs.

3. **CLI Tool**:
   - Automate spec validation, testing, and deployment.

---

## **Benefits**

1. **Minimal Effort**: Developers focus on writing OpenAPI specs, reducing boilerplate code.
2. **Consistency**: Standardized validation, routing, and error handling across all services.
3. **Adaptability**: Easily adapt to spec changes by updating the OpenAPI document.
4. **Future-Proofing**: Reusable framework simplifies new service creation.

By following this plan, the FountainAI team can establish a robust, dynamic, and reusable framework for building OpenAPI-compliant microservices with minimal effort.
