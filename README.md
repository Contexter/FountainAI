## üìñ Project Overview

**FountainAI** is designed to manage various aspects of storytelling, character development, script management, session contexts, and sequence assignments through a suite of interconnected APIs. Leveraging a microservices architecture ensures modularity, scalability, and ease of maintenance. The key components include:

- **Central Sequence Service API**
- **Character Management API**
- **Core Script Management API**
- **Session Context Management API**
- **Story Factory API**

Each API is responsible for specific functionalities, interacting seamlessly through defined interfaces to provide a cohesive and efficient system.
