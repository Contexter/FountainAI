## Introduction

**FountainAI** is an advanced project aimed at revolutionizing narrative development through a microservices architecture that automates storytelling processes such as sequence management, character management, and session context orchestration. The core technologies include OpenAI's GPT-4, FastAPI, Docker, and AWS infrastructure. The primary goal is to create a modular, scalable, and secure system that helps manage dynamic narratives with efficiency.

---

## Project Overview

The repository is structured to support the **development, deployment, and maintenance** of FountainAI services through:

- **Microservices Architecture**: Modular services that interact to provide narrative functionalities.
- **OpenAPI Specifications**: Centralized OpenAPI definitions for all services, enabling consistent API generation and validation.
- **Workbooks**: Step-by-step guides to generate, modify, and deploy components of FountainAI.

### Current Development Focus

The current development focus is on **automating code generation using OpenAPI** definitions, following the FountainAI workbook format for consistency and scalability. The system heavily relies on GPT-4 and shell scripting to facilitate this process. We are transitioning from earlier general guidance documents to a more focused, action-driven workbook format, meaning some older documentation is now marked as **deprecated**.

### Deprecation Notices

- The **Guidance** documents (`Part A`, `Part B`, and `Part C`) are now marked as **deprecated** in favor of the workbook-driven approach. These files remain for historical context but should not be referenced for current development.
- **Use Cases** have shifted away from abstract discussions (previously covered in "The Role of Context in FountainAI.md") and are now embedded into workbook-driven examples for each service.

---

## Implementation Plan

The implementation of FountainAI revolves around OpenAPI-driven code generation and workbook-guided service development. The key steps include:

### 1. Define Service Specifications
  - Use **OpenAPI** to document the APIs for services such as the **Central Sequence Service**, **Character Management**, and others.
  - YAML files are stored in the `openAPI` directory and serve as the foundation for automated code generation.

### 2. Code Generation via Workbooks
  - The **FountainAI Code Generation Workbook** guides developers on interacting with OpenAI GPT-4 to generate FastAPI service code from OpenAPI definitions.
  - Each service has a specific workbook that provides structured steps to follow, including shell scripts for code generation and modification.

### 3. Modify and Standardize Code
  - Adhere to FountainAI coding norms by modifying generated code using the provided workbooks and shell scripts.
  - Ensure consistency in formatting, logging, and environment management.

### 4. Deployment and Security
  - Services are deployed using **Docker** containers on **AWS** infrastructure (ECS/Fargate).
  - Use **AWS CloudFormation** and **CI/CD pipelines** for automated deployments.
  - Implement **HTTPS** across all stages using **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)**.

---

## Development Standards

The **FountainAI Workbook Format** is central to development, ensuring consistency and scalability across all services.

### Workbook Format

- **Introduction**: Overview of the service or task.
- **Prerequisites**: Tools, libraries, and access needed.
- **Step-by-Step Instructions**: Detailed walkthrough of tasks, including code snippets and shell scripts.
- **Shell Scripting**: Idempotent shell scripts following the FountainAI norms, provided for automating various tasks.
- **Visualization**: ASCII diagrams first, followed by **Graphviz** or **pre-rendered images** for more complex visualizations.

### Visualization Standards

- **ASCII Diagrams** are the primary visualization tool for simplicity.
- Use **Graphviz DOT** language for more complex diagrams.
- Store both source and rendered diagrams for version control in the `Diagrams` directory (to be added).

### Shell Scripting Guidelines

- **Modular and Idempotent**: Shell scripts must be reusable and safe to run multiple times.
- Scripts generate code, configure environments, and manage deployments.

### Security Practices

- **HTTPS Everywhere**: Ensure HTTPS is enforced using SSL/TLS certificates provided by **AWS Certificate Manager**.
- **Environment Configuration**: Use environment variables to manage sensitive information securely.
- **Secret Management**: Employ **AWS Secrets Manager** where necessary.
