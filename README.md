### OpenAPI Specification

The OpenAPI specification serves as the detailed blueprint for FountainAI, transitioning from the high-level conceptual model to a precise API definition. It outlines all the endpoints, request/response formats, and data models, ensuring that developers have a clear and consistent reference for implementing the AI. The OpenAPI specification for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/Contexter/fountainAI/blob/main/openAPI/FountainAI-Admin-openAPI.yaml).
