## Introduction

The **FountainAI Implementation Guide** serves as the definitive blueprint for developing, deploying, and maintaining the FountainAI system. This extended guide integrates **API versioning** across all existing and future APIs and transitions the database system from **SQLite** to **PostgreSQL**, aligning with best practices for scalable and robust microservices architecture. The guide encompasses system descriptions, implementation requirements, detailed FastAPI implementation paths, versioning strategies, database migration, and guidelines for leveraging the GPT model to automate code generation.

---

## System Overview

**FountainAI** is architected to manage story elements such as scripts, characters, actions, spoken words, sessions, context, and the logical flow of stories. The system is composed of several key components:

1. **Independent Microservices:** Five FastAPI applications, each responsible for specific aspects of story management.
2. **Kong API Gateway:** Serves as the single entry point for all API requests, handling routing, authentication, rate limiting, and other cross-cutting concerns.
3. **Docker Compose:** Orchestrates the deployment of microservices, Kong, and the PostgreSQL database.
4. **Amazon Route 53:** Manages DNS records, mapping domain names to services.
5. **GPT Model:** Facilitates orchestration by interacting with services based on OpenAPI specifications.

This modular architecture ensures scalability, maintainability, and ease of deployment, adhering to modern microservices best practices.

---

## Architecture Summary

### Components:

1. **Independent Microservices:**
   - **Technologies:** FastAPI, PostgreSQL
   - **Characteristics:**
     - Each microservice is self-contained.
     - Manages its own database schema within PostgreSQL.
     - Exposes RESTful APIs as per its OpenAPI specification.
     - Does not assume the existence of other services.
     - Focuses on a specific domain or functionality.
     - Implements versioning and migrations using Alembic.
   
2. **Kong API Gateway:**
   - Acts as a single entry point for all API requests.
   - Routes requests to the appropriate microservice based on hostnames and paths.
   - Provides features like authentication, rate limiting, logging, and SSL termination.
   - Manages API versioning strategies.
   
3. **Docker Compose:**
   - Orchestrates the deployment of microservices, Kong, and PostgreSQL.
   - Defines service configurations, networks, and volumes.
   - Ensures seamless communication between services.
   
4. **PostgreSQL Database:**
   - Serves as the central database system.
   - Provides robustness, scalability, and advanced features over SQLite.
   - Managed using Alembic for migrations and versioning.
   
5. **Amazon Route 53:**
   - Manages DNS records for the domain (`fountain.coach`).
   - Maps domain names to the Kong API Gateway or load balancer.
   
6. **GPT Model:**
   - Orchestrates interactions between microservices by making API calls.
   - Uses OpenAPI specifications to understand and interact with the APIs.

## Implementation Requirements

### Explicit OpenAPI Compliance

#### Importance of Compliance

Ensuring compliance with OpenAPI specifications is critical for:

- **Interoperability:** Allowing various services to communicate effectively.
- **Documentation:** Providing accurate API documentation for developers and users.
- **Maintainability:** Simplifying the process of updating and managing the API.
- **Versioning:** Facilitating smooth transitions between different API versions.

#### FastAPI Route Definitions

Each FastAPI route must explicitly define the following parameters:

- **Operation ID:** A unique identifier for each API operation that aligns with the OpenAPI specification.
- **Summary:** A brief description of what the API endpoint does.
- **Description:** A detailed explanation of the endpoint’s purpose and usage (not exceeding a 300-character maximum limit).

##### Example Implementation

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, status, Depends
from pydantic import BaseModel
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from app.database import get_db

app = FastAPI()

class SequenceRequest(BaseModel):
    elementType: str

class SequenceResponse(BaseModel):
    sequenceNumber: int

@app.post(
    "/sequence", 
    response_model=SequenceResponse, 
    status_code=status.HTTP_201_CREATED,
    summary="Generate Sequence Number", 
    description="Generates a new sequence number for a specified element type.",
    operation_id="generateSequenceNumber"
)
def generate_sequence_number(request: SequenceRequest, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    # Placeholder logic
    sequence_number = 1  # TODO: Implement actual logic
    return SequenceResponse(sequenceNumber=sequence_number)
```

#### Additional Considerations

- Ensure that **all** endpoints in the API are documented in this manner to maintain consistency.
- Regularly review and update the OpenAPI specifications alongside the codebase to prevent discrepancies.
- Implement versioning strategies within the OpenAPI specs to manage different API versions effectively.

---

### FastAPI Implementation Guidelines

#### Structure and Modularity

- Use a clear project structure that separates concerns, such as routing, models, and database interactions.
- Maintain modularity by breaking down functionality into reusable components.

#### Idempotency and Determinism

- Ensure that all shell scripts and FastAPI endpoints are idempotent, meaning they can be safely called multiple times without unintended effects.
- Implement deterministic behaviors that lead to predictable outcomes, enhancing the reliability of the system.

#### Testing and Validation

- Develop unit tests for each endpoint to validate that they behave as expected and conform to the OpenAPI definitions.
- Use **pytest** and **FastAPI’s testing capabilities** to write comprehensive test cases.
- Include tests for different API versions to ensure backward compatibility.

---

### Shell Scripting Practices

#### Overview

Shell scripts play a crucial role in automating the deployment and configuration of FountainAI services. Adhering to a consistent scripting style will simplify maintenance and enhance readability.

#### Key Principles

- **Modularity:** Create functions for repetitive tasks to avoid redundancy.
- **Idempotency:** Ensure that running scripts multiple times does not alter the system state unexpectedly.
- **Documentation:** Comment thoroughly to explain the purpose of each function and script.

##### Example Shell Script Structure

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Function to initialize the project
initialize_project() {
    # Create directories and virtual environment
    # Install dependencies
}

# Function to generate FastAPI app
generate_fastapi_app() {
    # Generate models and routes based on OpenAPI spec
}

# Main execution
initialize_project
generate_fastapi_app
```

---

### Versioning and Migrations

#### Importance of Versioning and Migrations

- **API Versioning:** Facilitates the evolution of APIs without disrupting existing clients.
- **Database Migrations:** Manages schema changes systematically, ensuring data integrity and consistency across environments.
- **Future-Proofing:** Prepares the system for scalability and adaptability to future requirements.

#### Implementing Versioning with Alembic

- **Alembic:** A lightweight database migration tool for SQLAlchemy. It manages database schema changes effectively.
- **Integration:** Incorporate Alembic into all microservices to handle migrations seamlessly.
- **Standardization:** Establish a consistent migration process across all APIs to maintain uniformity.

---

### Database Transition to PostgreSQL

#### Reasons for Choosing PostgreSQL

- **Scalability:** Handles large volumes of data and high concurrency efficiently.
- **Advanced Features:** Supports advanced data types, indexing, and full-text search.
- **Reliability:** Offers robust transaction management and data integrity.
- **Ecosystem:** Rich ecosystem with extensive tooling and community support.

#### Migration Steps

1. **Install PostgreSQL:** Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running in your deployment environment.
2. **Update Database Configurations:** Modify database connection strings to point to PostgreSQL.
3. **Handle Data Migration:** If transitioning from existing SQLite databases, migrate data accordingly.
4. **Update ORM Settings:** Configure SQLAlchemy to interact with PostgreSQL.
5. **Adjust Docker Compose:** Include PostgreSQL as a service within Docker Compose for containerized deployments.

---

## Implementation Path

The following steps outline the detailed path to implement the FountainAI system, ensuring alignment with the system description and implementation requirements.

---

### 1. Define OpenAPI Specifications

**Objective:** Create detailed OpenAPI specifications for each microservice, serving as the single source of truth.

**Actions:**

- **Document All Endpoints:**
  - Define all API endpoints, HTTP methods, and paths.
  - Incorporate versioning into the URL paths (e.g., `/v1/sequence`).
  
- **Define Schemas:**
  - Specify request and response schemas using JSON Schema.
  
- **Include Examples:**
  - Provide example requests and responses for clarity.
  
- **Authentication and Security Schemes:**
  - Define any required authentication mechanisms.
  
**Tools:**

- Use OpenAPI 3.0 or 3.1 YAML or JSON format.
- Utilize editors like Swagger Editor or Stoplight Studio.

**Deliverables:**

- `central_sequence_service_openapi.yaml`
- `character_management_api_openapi.yaml`
- `core_script_management_api_openapi.yaml`
- `session_context_management_api_openapi.yaml`
- `story_factory_api_openapi.yaml`

**Versioning Consideration:**

- Embed version numbers within the URL paths to manage different API versions effectively.
  
  **Example:**
  
  ```yaml
  paths:
    /v1/sequence:
      post:
        ...
    /v2/sequence:
      post:
        ...
  ```

---

### 2. Generate Pydantic Models and API Stubs

**Objective:** Generate Pydantic models and FastAPI stubs based on the OpenAPI specifications to ensure exact conformity.

**Actions:**

- **Use OpenAPI Code Generators:**
  - Utilize tools like `datamodel-code-generator` to generate Pydantic models.
  - Use `fastapi-codegen` to generate FastAPI stubs.

**Commands:**

- Install code generation tools:

  ```bash
  pip install datamodel-code-generator fastapi-codegen
  ```

- Generate models:

  ```bash
  datamodel-codegen --input character_management_api_openapi.yaml --input-file-type openapi --output character_management_api/models.py
  ```

- Generate FastAPI stubs:

  ```bash
  fastapi-codegen --input character_management_api_openapi.yaml --output character_management_api
  ```

**Deliverables:**

- `models.py` files containing Pydantic models for each microservice.
- FastAPI project structure with stub files for each endpoint.

**Versioning Consideration:**

- Ensure that versioned paths are handled correctly in the generated stubs.
  
  **Example:**
  
  - For `/v1/sequence`, generate a router that handles version 1.
  - For `/v2/sequence`, generate a separate router or extend the existing one with version-specific logic.

---

### 3. Implement FastAPI Applications

**Objective:** Implement the FastAPI applications using the generated models and stubs, ensuring adherence to the OpenAPI specs.

**Actions:**

- **Project Structure:**

  For each microservice, organize the project as follows:

  ```
  microservice_name/
  ├── app/
  │   ├── __init__.py
  │   ├── main.py
  │   ├── api/
  │   │   ├── __init__.py
  │   │   ├── v1/
  │   │   │   ├── __init__.py
  │   │   │   ├── endpoints.py
  │   │   ├── v2/
  │   │   │   ├── __init__.py
  │   │   │   ├── endpoints.py
  │   ├── models.py
  │   ├── schemas.py
  │   ├── database.py
  ├── migrations/
  ├── tests/
  ├── requirements.txt
  ├── Dockerfile
  └── README.md
  ```

- **Integrate Generated Models:**

  - Place the generated `models.py` and `schemas.py` into the `app/` directory.
  - Ensure that the Pydantic models (`schemas.py`) are used for request validation and response serialization.

- **Set Up FastAPI App:**

  ```python
  # app/main.py
  from fastapi import FastAPI
  from app.api.v1 import router as v1_router
  from app.api.v2 import router as v2_router
  from app.database import engine, Base
  
  app = FastAPI(
      title="Central Sequence Service API",
      version="1.0.0",
      description="This API manages the assignment and updating of sequence numbers for various elements within a story, ensuring logical order and consistency."
  )
  
  # Create all tables
  Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
  
  # Include routers for different API versions
  app.include_router(v1_router, prefix="/v1", tags=["v1"])
  app.include_router(v2_router, prefix="/v2", tags=["v2"])
  ```

- **Implement API Endpoints:**

  ```python
  # app/api/v1/endpoints.py
  from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException, status
  from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
  from app import schemas, models_db
  from app.database import get_db
  
  router = APIRouter()
  
  @router.post(
      "/sequence",
      response_model=schemas.SequenceResponse,
      status_code=status.HTTP_201_CREATED,
      summary="Generate Sequence Number",
      description="Generates a new sequence number for a specified element type.",
      operation_id="generateSequenceNumberV1"
  )
  def generate_sequence_number_v1(request: schemas.SequenceRequest, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
      # Placeholder logic
      sequence_number = 1  # TODO: Implement actual logic
      return schemas.SequenceResponse(sequenceNumber=sequence_number)
  ```

  ```python
  # app/api/v2/endpoints.py
  from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException, status
  from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
  from app import schemas, models_db
  from app.database import get_db
  
  router = APIRouter()
  
  @router.post(
      "/sequence",
      response_model=schemas.SequenceResponse,
      status_code=status.HTTP_201_CREATED,
      summary="Generate Sequence Number",
      description="Generates a new sequence number for a specified element type with enhanced logic.",
      operation_id="generateSequenceNumberV2"
  )
  def generate_sequence_number_v2(request: schemas.SequenceRequest, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
      # Enhanced logic for version 2
      sequence_number = 2  # TODO: Implement enhanced logic
      return schemas.SequenceResponse(sequenceNumber=sequence_number)
  ```

- **Implement Versioned Logic:**

  - Maintain separate routers or namespaces for each API version.
  - Ensure that changes in version 2 do not affect version 1.

---

### 4. Set Up Database Models and Persistence

**Objective:** Define SQLAlchemy models, set up the PostgreSQL database connection, and manage migrations using Alembic.

**Actions:**

- **Database Configuration:**

  ```python
  # app/database.py
  from sqlalchemy import create_engine
  from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
  from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
  
  import os
  
  DATABASE_USER = os.getenv("POSTGRES_USER", "fountainai_user")
  DATABASE_PASSWORD = os.getenv("POSTGRES_PASSWORD", "securepassword")
  DATABASE_HOST = os.getenv("POSTGRES_HOST", "postgres")
  DATABASE_PORT = os.getenv("POSTGRES_PORT", "5432")
  DATABASE_NAME = os.getenv("POSTGRES_DB", "fountainai_db")
  
  SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = f"postgresql://{DATABASE_USER}:{DATABASE_PASSWORD}@{DATABASE_HOST}:{DATABASE_PORT}/{DATABASE_NAME}"
  
  engine = create_engine(
      SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL
  )
  
  SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)
  
  Base = declarative_base()
  
  # Dependency for FastAPI
  def get_db():
      db = SessionLocal()
      try:
          yield db
      finally:
          db.close()
  ```

- **Define SQLAlchemy Models:**

  ```python
  # app/models_db.py
  from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, JSON, ForeignKey, DateTime, func
  from app.database import Base
  from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship
  
  class SequenceDB(Base):
      __tablename__ = 'sequences'
  
      id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
      element_type = Column(String, index=True)
      element_id = Column(Integer, index=True, nullable=True)
      sequence_number = Column(Integer, default=1)
  
      versions = relationship("SequenceVersionDB", back_populates="sequence")
  
  class SequenceVersionDB(Base):
      __tablename__ = 'sequence_versions'
  
      id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
      sequence_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('sequences.id'), nullable=False)
      version_number = Column(Integer, nullable=False)
      version_data = Column(JSON, nullable=False)
      created_at = Column(DateTime(timezone=True), server_default=func.now())
  
      sequence = relationship("SequenceDB", back_populates="versions")
  
  # Similarly, define models for other APIs (characters, actions, etc.)
  ```

- **Initialize Database Tables:**

  Ensure that all tables are created during application startup.

  ```python
  # app/main.py
  from app.database import engine, Base
  from app.api import router
  
  Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
  ```

- **Alembic Integration:**

  - Initialize Alembic as per the [Versioning and Migrations](#versioning-and-migrations) section.
  - Create migration scripts for all initial tables and future changes.

---

### 5. Implement Endpoint Logic

**Objective:** Implement the business logic for each endpoint, ensuring that all operations conform to the OpenAPI specifications and handle versioning appropriately.

**Actions:**

- **CRUD Operations:**
  - Implement Create, Read, Update, Delete operations as defined in each API version.
  - Use the database session (`db: Session = Depends(get_db)`) for database interactions.

- **Error Handling:**
  - Raise appropriate HTTP exceptions (`HTTPException`) with correct status codes and detail messages.

- **Version-Specific Logic:**
  - Implement different logic in different API versions to handle enhancements or changes without affecting existing clients.

**Example: Implementing Versioned Endpoints**

```python
# app/api/v1/endpoints.py
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException, status
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from app import schemas, models_db
from app.database import get_db

router = APIRouter()

@router.post(
    "/sequence",
    response_model=schemas.SequenceResponse,
    status_code=status.HTTP_201_CREATED,
    summary="Generate Sequence Number",
    description="Generates a new sequence number for a specified element type.",
    operation_id="generateSequenceNumberV1"
)
def generate_sequence_number_v1(request: schemas.SequenceRequest, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    sequence = db.query(models_db.SequenceDB).filter_by(element_type=request.elementType, element_id=request.elementId).first()
    if not sequence:
        sequence = models_db.SequenceDB(element_type=request.elementType, element_id=request.elementId, sequence_number=1)
        db.add(sequence)
    else:
        sequence.sequence_number += 1
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(sequence)
    return schemas.SequenceResponse(sequenceNumber=sequence.sequence_number)
```

```python
# app/api/v2/endpoints.py
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException, status
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from app import schemas, models_db
from app.database import get_db

router = APIRouter()

@router.post(
    "/sequence",
    response_model=schemas.SequenceResponse,
    status_code=status.HTTP_201_CREATED,
    summary="Generate Sequence Number",
    description="Generates a new sequence number for a specified element type with enhanced logic.",
    operation_id="generateSequenceNumberV2"
)
def generate_sequence_number_v2(request: schemas.SequenceRequest, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    sequence = db.query(models_db.SequenceDB).filter_by(element_type=request.elementType, element_id=request.elementId).first()
    if not sequence:
        sequence = models_db.SequenceDB(element_type=request.elementType, element_id=request.elementId, sequence_number=100)  # Enhanced starting number
        db.add(sequence)
    else:
        sequence.sequence_number += 10  # Enhanced increment
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(sequence)
    return schemas.SequenceResponse(sequenceNumber=sequence.sequence_number)
```

**Versioning Consideration:**

- Maintain separate routers for each API version to encapsulate version-specific logic.
- Ensure that changes in one version do not interfere with others, preserving backward compatibility.

---

### 6. Testing and Validation

**Objective:** Ensure that the FastAPI applications function correctly, conform to the OpenAPI specifications, and handle versioning appropriately.

**Actions:**

- **Unit Tests:**
  - Write tests for individual functions and methods within each API version.
  
- **Integration Tests:**
  - Use `TestClient` from FastAPI for testing endpoints across different versions.
  
- **Version-Specific Tests:**
  - Validate that each API version behaves as expected, especially when introducing breaking or non-breaking changes.
  
- **Database Migration Tests:**
  - Ensure that migrations apply correctly and do not disrupt existing data or functionality.
  
**Example: Test Cases for Versioned APIs**

```python
# tests/test_v1_sequence.py
import pytest
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from app.main import app
from app.database import Base, engine, SessionLocal
from app.models_db import SequenceDB, SequenceVersionDB
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

client = TestClient(app)

@pytest.fixture(scope="module")
def test_db_v1():
    # Create the database and the tables
    Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
    db = SessionLocal()
    yield db
    db.close()
    # Drop the tables after the test
    Base.metadata.drop_all(bind=engine)

def test_generate_sequence_number_v1(test_db_v1):
    response = client.post("/v1/sequence", json={"elementType": "script", "elementId": 1})
    assert response.status_code == 201
    assert response.json()["sequenceNumber"] == 1

def test_generate_sequence_number_increment_v1(test_db_v1):
    response = client.post("/v1/sequence", json={"elementType": "script", "elementId": 1})
    assert response.status_code == 201
    assert response.json()["sequenceNumber"] == 2
```

```python
# tests/test_v2_sequence.py
import pytest
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from app.main import app
from app.database import Base, engine, SessionLocal
from app.models_db import SequenceDB, SequenceVersionDB
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

client = TestClient(app)

@pytest.fixture(scope="module")
def test_db_v2():
    # Create the database and the tables
    Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
    db = SessionLocal()
    yield db
    db.close()
    # Drop the tables after the test
    Base.metadata.drop_all(bind=engine)

def test_generate_sequence_number_v2(test_db_v2):
    response = client.post("/v2/sequence", json={"elementType": "script", "elementId": 2})
    assert response.status_code == 201
    assert response.json()["sequenceNumber"] == 100

def test_generate_sequence_number_increment_v2(test_db_v2):
    response = client.post("/v2/sequence", json={"elementType": "script", "elementId": 2})
    assert response.status_code == 201
    assert response.json()["sequenceNumber"] == 110
```

**Instructions:**

1. **Save Test Files:**
   - Save the above test cases in the `tests/` directory as `test_v1_sequence.py` and `test_v2_sequence.py`.

2. **Run Tests:**
   ```bash
   cd central_sequence_service
   source venv/bin/activate
   pytest
   ```

3. **Ensure All Tests Pass:**
   - Validate that both version 1 and version 2 tests pass, confirming correct versioned behavior.

---

### 7. Containerization with Docker

**Objective:** Containerize each FastAPI application using Docker, ensuring consistent deployment environments and facilitating scalability.

**Actions:**

- **Create Dockerfile:**
  
  ```dockerfile
  # central_sequence_service/app/Dockerfile
  
  # Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
  FROM python:3.9-slim
  
  # Set environment variables
  ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1
  ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
  
  # Set the working directory in the container
  WORKDIR /app
  
  # Install system dependencies
  RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
      build-essential \
      libpq-dev \
      && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
  
  # Copy the requirements file into the container
  COPY requirements.txt .
  
  # Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
  RUN pip install --upgrade pip
  RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
  
  # Copy the rest of the application code into the container
  COPY . .
  
  # Install Alembic
  RUN pip install alembic
  
  # Run Alembic migrations
  RUN alembic upgrade head
  
  # Expose port
  EXPOSE 8080
  
  # Command to run the application
  CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8080"]
  ```
  
  **Explanation:**
  
  - **System Dependencies:** Installs `build-essential` and `libpq-dev` for compiling Python packages and interfacing with PostgreSQL.
  - **Alembic Migrations:** Runs `alembic upgrade head` during the build process to apply migrations automatically.
  
- **Update `requirements.txt`:**

  Ensure that `requirements.txt` includes all necessary dependencies, including Alembic.

  ```text
  fastapi
  uvicorn
  pydantic
  sqlalchemy
  alembic
  psycopg2-binary
  ```

- **Build and Run Docker Image:**

  ```bash
  docker build -t central_sequence_service ./central_sequence_service/app
  docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name central_sequence_service central_sequence_service
  ```

**Versioning Consideration:**

- Tag Docker images with version numbers corresponding to API versions for better traceability.
  
  **Example:**
  
  ```bash
  docker build -t central_sequence_service:v1 ./central_sequence_service/app
  docker build -t central_sequence_service:v2 ./central_sequence_service/app
  ```

  ```

  **Explanation:**
  
  - **Services and Routes:** Defines separate services and routes for each API version.
  - **Plugins:** Applies rate-limiting plugins to manage API usage.
  
- **Shell Script: `configure_kong.sh`**
  
  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  
  # Function to configure Kong
  configure_kong() {
      echo "Configuring Kong..."
  
      # Define variables
      KONG_ADMIN_URL="http://localhost:8001"
  
      # Apply declarative configuration
      curl -X POST "$KONG_ADMIN_URL/config" -F "config=@kong.yml" -F "replace=true"
  
      echo "Kong configuration applied from 'kong.yml'."
  }
  
  # Main function
  configure_kong_main() {
      # Ensure Kong is running and Admin API is accessible
      if ! curl -s "$KONG_ADMIN_URL" &> /dev/null; then
          echo "Kong Admin API not accessible at '$KONG_ADMIN_URL'. Please ensure Kong is running."
          exit 1
      fi
  
      configure_kong
      echo "Kong API Gateway configured successfully."
  }
  
  # Execute the main function
  configure_kong_main
  ```
  
  **Instructions:**
  
  1. **Save the Script:**
     Save the above script as `configure_kong.sh` in the parent directory.
  
  2. **Make the Script Executable:**
     ```bash
     chmod +x configure_kong.sh
     ```
  
  3. **Run the Script:**
     ```bash
     ./configure_kong.sh
     ```
  
  **Versioning Consideration:**
  
  - Manage separate routes and services for each API version to ensure clear separation and backward compatibility.

  # Execute the main function
  deploy_and_configure_dns_main
  ```

  **Instructions:**

  1. **Prerequisites:**
     - **AWS CLI Installed and Configured:**
       Ensure you have the AWS CLI installed and configured with the necessary permissions to modify Route 53 records.
     - **Kong's Public IP:**
       Determine the public IP address where Kong is accessible. This could be an EC2 instance's public IP, a load balancer IP, etc.
  
  2. **Update Variables:**
     - Open `deploy_and_configure_dns.sh` and replace:
       - `YOUR_HOSTED_ZONE_ID` with your actual Route 53 hosted zone ID.
       - `YOUR_KONG_PUBLIC_IP` with the public IP address of your Kong API Gateway.
  
  3. **Save the Script:**
     Save the above script as `deploy_and_configure_dns.sh` in the parent directory.
  
  4. **Make the Script Executable:**
     ```bash
     chmod +x deploy_and_configure_dns.sh
     ```
  
  5. **Run the Script:**
     ```bash
     ./deploy_and_configure_dns.sh
     ```
  
     This will:
     - Create `docker-compose.yml` to orchestrate the services.
     - Create `kong.yml` for declarative configuration of Kong.
     - Update Route 53 DNS records to point `centralsequence.fountain.coach` to Kong's public IP.
  
  6. **Deploy Services with Docker Compose:**
     ```bash
     docker-compose up -d
     ```
  
     This ensures that:
     - PostgreSQL is running and accessible to the Central Sequence Service.
     - The Central Sequence Service is up and connected to PostgreSQL.
     - Kong API Gateway is routing requests to the appropriate API versions.
  
  7. **Verify Deployment:**
     - Access the API via `http://centralsequence.fountain.coach/v1/sequence`.
     - Access the versioned API via `http://centralsequence.fountain.coach/v2/sequence`.
     - Ensure that Kong is routing requests correctly and applying rate limiting as configured.
  
  **Versioning Consideration:**
  
  - Maintain separate services and routes for each API version within Kong to ensure clear separation and backward compatibility.
  - Monitor and manage API versions to handle deprecations gracefully.

## GPT Code Generation Sessions

### Overview

The **GPT Code Generation Sessions** are designed to automate the creation of FastAPI applications based on existing OpenAPI specifications. By providing the GPT model with the OpenAPI documents, it generates shell scripts that:

- Initialize projects.
- Generate FastAPI code with precise `operationId`, `summary`, and `description` fields.
- Implement business logic.
- Set up testing environments.
- Dockerize applications.
- Configure API gateways and DNS settings.
- Manage database migrations with Alembic.
- Handle PostgreSQL integration.

These scripts follow the **FountainAI convention** for shell scripting, ensuring modularity, idempotency, and deterministic execution.

### Example: Central Sequence Service API with Versioning and PostgreSQL
