You are updating the `4c` document of the **Typesense Client Microservice** to ensure it is a **fully comprehensive implementation guide**.

### **ðŸ”¹ Key Fixes You Must Implement**
1. **Ensure all application files are fully represented**
   - Include `main.py`, `config.py`, `typesense_service.py`, and `schemas/` subdirectory.
   - Each file should be complete and functionally correct.

2. **Maintain the microservice's primary function**  
   - This service acts as a **purely decoupled indexing/search microservice**.
   - It should not enforce any data modeling.
   - Other services (like `Service A`) should be able to interact with it **without schema modifications**.

3. **Clarify API endpoints and interactions**
   - The FastAPI routes should be **fully documented** in `main.py`.
   - The `typesense_service.py` must handle **collection creation, document upserts, and search operations**.

4. **Ensure proper integration with KMS (Key Management Service)**
   - API key retrieval must be **dynamic**, ensuring no hardcoded secrets.
   - The document should clearly explain **how the microservice retrieves and uses its API key from KMS**.

5. **Provide correct deployment and verification instructions**
   - **Ensure Typesense is properly set up** before running the service.
   - The document should include **clear Docker instructions**.
   - Health checks should be **documented and validated**.

6. **Include the Future Enhancements Section in a Dedicated Section**  
   - Clearly **separate** planned features from the current implementation.
   - Ensure the document remains a **usable reference for deploying the service today**.
   - The **Future Enhancements** section should include:
     - **Multi-Tenant API Key Support**: Allowing per-tenant API keys for fine-grained access control.
     - **Hybrid Vector + Full-Text Search**: Storing and searching vector embeddings alongside text for AI-driven search.
     - **Automated Data Sync from External Databases**: Implementing background tasks for real-time indexing.
     - **Fine-Grained Query Restrictions**: Implementing per-user search filtering via Typesense's scoped queries.
     - **Versioned Collection Updates**: Supporting schema evolution via new collection versions without downtime.

### **ðŸš€ Task:**
- The `4c` document must be updated correctly **without removing existing functionality**.
- Maintain **full source code listings** for every application file.
- Preserve all **deployment, API, and integration details**.
- Ensure **Future Enhancements** exist in a **separate, clearly labeled section**, so they do not overwrite existing functionality.

This update is required because previous models produced incorrect context by failing to summarize missing details accurately. You must ensure **all critical application details are properly represented** in the final document.
