Hereâ€™s a definitive tutorial, from start to finish, on how to set up and use SSH for GitHub on your local machine. This tutorial includes generating SSH keys, adding them to GitHub, and configuring Git to use SSH.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Step 1: Generate SSH Key (if it does not exist)
echo "Checking for existing SSH keys..."
if [ ! -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 ]; then
    echo "No SSH key found. Generating a new SSH key..."
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com" -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -N ""
    echo "New SSH key generated."
else
    echo "SSH key already exists."
fi

# Step 2: Start the SSH Agent and Add Key
echo "Starting the SSH agent..."
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
echo "Adding the SSH key to the SSH agent..."
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# Step 3: Copy SSH Key to Clipboard (Adjust command for macOS with `pbcopy`)
echo "Copying SSH public key to clipboard..."
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | xclip -selection clipboard

echo "SSH public key copied to clipboard. Please add this key to your GitHub account."
echo "Visit GitHub -> Settings -> SSH and GPG keys -> New SSH key."
echo "Title your key and paste the copied public key there."

# Pause for user action
read -p "Press [Enter] key after you've added the key to your GitHub account..."

# Step 4: Test SSH Connection
echo "Testing SSH connection to GitHub..."
if ssh -T git@github.com; then
    echo "SSH connection established."
else
    echo "Failed to establish an SSH connection to GitHub. Check your SSH key settings on GitHub."
    exit 1
fi

# Step 5: Configure Git to Use SSH
echo "Configuring Git to use SSH..."
git config --global url."git@github.com:".insteadOf "https://github.com/"

# Step 6: Change Repository Remote URL to SSH (replace 'username' and 'repo' appropriately)
echo "Updating Git remote URL to use SSH..."
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repo.git

echo "Git is now configured to use SSH for GitHub operations."

# Step 7: Adjust File Permissions (if necessary)
echo "Adjusting file permissions to avoid potential issues..."
sudo chown -R $(whoami) $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
sudo chmod -R u+rw $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
echo "File permissions adjusted."

echo "Setup complete. Your system is now configured to use SSH with GitHub."
```

### Tutorial Details:

1. **SSH Key Management**: Generates an SSH key if one does not already exist, adds this key to the SSH agent, and instructs the user to add this key to their GitHub account.
2. **Testing and Configuration**: Confirms the SSH connection to GitHub and configures Git to use SSH instead of HTTPS, avoiding the need for password authentication.
3. **Permission Adjustment**: Ensures the user has the appropriate file permissions within the Git repository directory to prevent common `git` errors.

This script is comprehensive and should be run from the terminal. It assumes that tools like `ssh-keygen`, `ssh-add`, and `xclip` (or `pbcopy` on macOS) are installed on your system. Adjust `username` and `repo` to your GitHub username and repository name, respectively.
