## Executive Summary

As of October 15, 2024, the FountainAI project has achieved major milestones in formalizing its development processes with the **FountainAI Workbook Guide**. In addition, legacy components have been deprecated, and new **OpenAPI v2 standards** have been integrated. Recently, the project has embraced **ChatGPT-4 with Canvas** to enhance the development workflow, providing a visual and interactive interface for handling complex service orchestration. Moving forward, the project is also preparing for the use of **AWS Copilot**, which will further streamline deployment within the **workbook-driven development process**.
