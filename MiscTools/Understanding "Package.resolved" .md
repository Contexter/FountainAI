The `Package.resolved` file that you see in your Vapor project after compiling and running the application is part of Swift Package Manager's (SPM) management of your project's dependencies. Here's what you need to know about this file and whether or not it should be added to your version control repository:

### Understanding Package.resolved

The `Package.resolved` file is a lock file that SPM generates and updates. It records the exact versions of dependencies that your project is currently using. This includes not only the direct dependencies listed in your `Package.swift` but also the resolved versions of any transitive dependencies (dependencies of your dependencies). Hereâ€™s why this is important:

- **Consistency Across Environments**: The file ensures that the same versions of dependencies are used in every environment (development, testing, production), which helps in reducing "it works on my machine" problems.
- **Dependency Version Tracking**: It locks your dependencies to specific versions that are known to work together, which can prevent unintended updates that might break your build or introduce incompatibilities.

### Should It Be Added to the Repository?

**Yes**, it is generally recommended to add the `Package.resolved` file to your version control repository for a few reasons:

1. **Consistent Builds**: Including the `Package.resolved` in your repository ensures that all team members and your deployment environments use the same versions of each package. This reduces conflicts arising from different team members or deployment pipelines fetching newer, potentially breaking versions of dependencies.
  
2. **Dependency Management**: If you have a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline, having the `Package.resolved` file checked in ensures that the CI/CD process uses the exact versions of dependencies that developers are using locally. This can help catch issues early and streamline deployment processes.

### How to Add Package.resolved to Git

If you decide to add the `Package.resolved` file to your repository (which is recommended for the above reasons), you can do so by simply adding and committing it like any other file:

```bash
git add Package.resolved
git commit -m "Add Package.resolved to track dependency versions"
git push
```

### Best Practices

- **Regular Updates**: Regularly update the dependencies in your `Package.swift` to newer versions as needed, and commit the changes in `Package.resolved` to keep your project up-to-date and secure.
- **Review Changes**: When updating dependencies or pulling changes that include modifications to `Package.resolved`, review these changes carefully to understand the impact of updating dependency versions.

By including `Package.resolved` in your version control system, you help ensure that your development team and any automated processes are working with a consistent set of dependencies, thereby avoiding many common issues related to dependency management in software projects.
