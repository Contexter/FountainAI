The Vapor Toolbox is a command-line tool designed to simplify the development and management of Vapor web applications. Vapor is a popular server-side Swift web framework, and the Toolbox provides essential functionality to streamline various aspects of app development.

#### Key Features:

1. **Project Creation:**
   - **New Projects:** The Toolbox can create new Vapor projects from scratch, setting up a basic structure that adheres to best practices.
   - **Templates:** It includes various templates and configurations, allowing you to create projects for different scenarios, such as web apps, APIs, or microservices.

2. **Docker Integration:**
   - **Dockerfiles:** The Toolbox generates a `Dockerfile` for building a Docker image of the Vapor application, making it easier to containerize the app.
   - **Docker Compose:** It can also provide a `docker-compose.yaml` configuration for managing multi-service setups, including integrations with databases, caches, or proxies.

3. **Dependency Management:**
   - **Swift Package Manager:** The Toolbox sets up `Package.swift` and `Package.resolved` files, defining the project's dependencies and enabling Swift Package Manager to resolve and install them.

4. **Project Structure:**
   - **Source Directory:** The Toolbox creates a standard directory structure, including a `Sources/` directory for the app's main code, resources directories, and testing directories.
   - **Resources:** It sets up directories for static resources, such as public assets or view templates.

5. **Command-Line Interface:**
   - **Server Commands:** The Toolbox provides commands to start the Vapor server locally, making it easy to develop and test apps on your machine.
   - **Database Management:** It includes commands to set up and manage database migrations, ensuring that your app's schema is consistent and up-to-date.

### What It Creates:

1. **Project Structure:** A standard directory structure, including `Sources/`, `Tests/`, and resource directories, adhering to best practices for web applications.

2. **Configuration Files:**
   - **`Dockerfile`:** For building a Docker image of the Vapor app.
   - **`docker-compose.yaml`:** For managing multi-service setups.
   - **`Package.swift` and `Package.resolved`:** For defining and resolving project dependencies.

3. **CLI Commands:** For managing the app, including starting the server, managing databases, and handling migrations.
